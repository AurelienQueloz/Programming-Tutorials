    "# What is programming?\n",
    "## Think like a programmer\n",
    "Steve Jobs once said: \"Everyone in this country should learn to program a computer, because it teaches you to think.\" His line of thought was that thinking like a programmer could help you solve problems outside of programming. \n",
    "But what does it mean to think like a programmer?\n",
    "\n",
    "A fitting description would be: \"Systemized problem solving\". By learning how to program you will learn a methodical approach of solving problems. To program a computer you need to analyse and understand the problem at hand and give clear instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "That same approach can easily be translated into other areas of life, be it personal or professional. Thinking like a programmer will not only help you to program but also help you to solve life's future challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivational example\n",
    "When thinking of programming languages and its use we might get stuck on the stereotype that programming is a hobby for geeks.\n",
    "To inspire business-savvy HSG students, we begin with some examples of companies or products that use Python which you might not have been aware of:\n",
    "\n",
    "Instagram web platform is largely written in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python was used to develop one of the most favorite shooters of the early 2000s, Battlefield 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further tech giants such  as Google, Facebook, Spotify, Quora, Netflix, and Dropbox also rely on Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other previously less tech oriented industries like banking also started implementing Python. A new trend emerged, called fintech.\n",
    "\n",
    "Companies like Robinhood use Python but also old and renown banks like Goldman Sachs or JPMorgan Chase are looking for programming knowledge in Python when hiring.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key takeaway from those examples should be that Python is used in a variety of businesses and industries. No matter if you want to start working at a tech company or a big bank, Python will be of use. \n",
    "\n",

    "# Introduction to Python\n",
    "## The baseline\n",
    "Once we have established that we have a problem on our hands that can be solved systematically by implementing it as a computer program, we need a language that computers can understand. Ideally, humans should be able to have a good grasp of that language as well, so that things do not get overly complicated. Fortunately, some early \"computer whisperers\" took a good bite out of that sour apple and established sophisticated translators - so called compilers or interpreters - that take over the step of converting systematized but human-readable programming languages (such as Python) into the ones and zeros the pieces of silicon in your computer are fluent in.\n",
    "\n",
    "While some, and especially the early programming languages require deeper knowledge of a wide range of aspects of how a computer works (see for example [memory management](https://wikipedia.org/en/memory_management)\\) in order to be used properly, some other, higher-level programming languages have been explicitly designed with maximizing human readability and useability in mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understandably, you might not be interested in some of the details of the historical development of Python, its relation to other languages and especially not other people's opinions on it (sorry, [Guido van Rossum](https://wikipedia.org/en/guido_van_rossum)!). You have decided on wanting to learn more about Python and how to use it and you are not mistaken in thinking it might be the programming language for you to get into the rabbit hole that is coding.\n",
    "\n",
    "As was already touched on in the previous paragraphs of this introductory tutorial, Python is very versatile in its applications and uses. It is widely relied upon in a host of different use-cases which include, but are not limited to:\n",
    "* mathematics, statistical analysis and scientific applications\n",
    "* scripting (little \"programs\" that do useful things on top of other programs and are often written on-the-fly)\n",
    "* web applications (see also: [Django](https://wikipedia.org/en/django_(web_framework))\\)\n",
    "* machine learning and artificial intelligence\n",
    "* development of full-scale applications\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Python\n",
    "As promised earlier, we will not go into an unnecessary degree of detail about the features and quirks which make Python one of the most widely used programming languages. However, there are some important points to bring up at this point in your learning process that will make your life a lot easier down the road and will also help steepen your learning curve even more than choosing Python already did.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages and how they help you\n",
    "* **Python is designed with simplicity in mind:** It is not a coincidence that there are so many beginner-level programming courses using Python. Its syntax is very readable, even if you are not a machine. It uses human language elements such as ```not```, ```and```, ```or``` to signify exatly what you would expect. Its use of indentation instead of brackets also makes it less prone to frustrating errors that simply come up because you used the wrong type of bracket in the wrong place.\n",
    "* **It is an interpreted, high-level language:** Python is in the category of interpreted languages which means you do not need to compile (i.e. \"translate\") your code before running it, the interpreter will take care of that on-the-fly. This means if you only want to write a few lines of code to get a job done, Python is the language for you. As your code will be translated (interpreted) line-by-line, finding and fixing errors in your code is far easier than with compiled languages. At the same time, Python is high-level, meaning fairly far away from machine code (ones and zeros) in order to be better understandable for humans.\n",
    "* **It comes with a large number of libraries:** Libraries are one of the central parts of Python that will allow you to build a vast array of applications quickly. They are essentially bundles of code that someone else has written in the past and has decided to share with other programmers. For you, this means you do not have to code everything from scratch but you can leverage existing solutions to get you where you want to be, quickly. To provide an example: If you would like to develop an automated trading strategy using Python, there are libraries you can use free of charge to easily backtest it, such as the [```Backtesting```](https://pypi.org/project/Backtesting/) library. By integrating this library into your code, you will be able to use code that someone else wrote to see how your investment strategy would have performed in the past, a standard way to check the validity of investment strategies. This way, instead of painstakingly coding everything yourself, you might be making money already!\n",
    "* **It is object-oriented and functional:** These are two of the main programming paradigms that dictate how you write code. In a nutshell, object orientation means data structures in your code will be modeled to resemble real world concepts. If you are writing a timetable app that shows which members of your team have appointments in a day or week, it might make sense to create a so called class for team members which contains the same type of information for every member. An instance of this class would be created to save everyone's name, email address and appointments. All of these instances are objects.<br> Functional programming is a different paradigm that focuses on creating, applying and interlinking functions. Similar to a mathematical function, a function in coding can take inputs and return outputs. In functional programming, functions can return other functions and act as data structures.<br> ***These concepts might sound abstract to you now, so the most important point to take away at this time is that you most likely will not be restricted by programming paradigms when using Python.***\n",
    "* **It is portable (including mobile applications):** Portability means that you can write code on any operating system and it will work exactly as well on any other operating system (with some minor limitations, of course).\n",
    "* **It is an open-source language:** As you might already know, Python is free to use even if you plan to sell programs you have written in it. So if you think you have a brilliant solution you would like to sell, you are free to do so without paying licensing fees.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Disadvantages\n",
    "* **It is limited in execution speed:** Simplicity comes at a price. While we mentioned above that the high-level, interpreted nature of Python helps users understand it more intuitively, the same cannot be said for machines. Compared to other languages, Python rides on more layers of \"translation\" which slows it down. However, do not fret as this will most likely not impact you (unless you are really into things like calculating millions of digits of pi).\n",
    "* **It has some design restrictions:** Again, it is the simplicity of Python that forces us to make some trade-offs. The use of so-called dynamic typing is an example for that. Dynamic typing means you do not have to declare what type a variable has (e.g. whether it is in form of text, called a [string](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/string) like ```\"hello world\"``` or whether it is a number such as an [integer](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/numbers) like ```42```) but that Python will figure it out by the time your code runs. While this makes your life much easier by removing another thing to think about, it can lead to errors in the code which you will have to deal with when you run it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Developing Python code\n",
    "In order for you to get started with writing your very own Python code, we think it is important for you to get to know some of the tools and utilities out there that will support whathever it is you are trying to achieve with programming. Now, you might say *wait a minute, I thought downloading Python itself is all I need to get started?* While technically you are absolutely right, Python (i.e. the Python interpreter that takes your Python code and feeds it to your processor) IS all you need at the very baseline. In the end, coding is nothing more than writing a bunch of \"special\" text that your computer will understand and you could do so by writing all your code into a text document and feeding it to the interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "While this *technically* works, there are a myriad of tools, many of them free of charge, to make your life easier and to assist you with writing code. Some of these tools, called integrated development environments or IDEs for short, will provide you with automation features such as giving you suggestions to automatically complete words you are writing, helping you to keep track of different parts of your code such as variables and functions (more on these in later tutorials) and highlighting certain parts of your code in certain colors to make it more readable. Most IDEs also come with so-called debuggers which help you track down errors in your code and suggest ways to resolve them. You will find a short overview over some IDEs and some more streamlined solutions to write code with in the second part of this chapter while the very next subchapter will guide you through the installation of Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing Python\n",
    "As mentioned earlier in this section of the tutorial, Python is free and open-source so you can download it from the [Python Software Foundation](https://python.org) website. Depending on the operating system you use, you will need to download different installers so follow the instructions for your OS below.\n",
    "\n",
    "**One important note before you start:** As you are most likely just starting out, we highly recommend you look into Google Colab for a quick and easy start. It includes everything you need for the very beginning and you will not have to deal with downloading Python, an IDE, and connecting the IDE to the interpreter. With Google Colab you can code conveniently in your browser and will be able to get going right away. Jump to [this section](#reference-2) to learn more.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Windows\n",
    "1. Go to the Windows section of the Python Software Foundation website [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) and on the left side of the page under \"Stable Releases\" go to the latest version (as of now 3.9.2) and click on either \"Windows installer (32-bit)\" or \"Windows installer (64-bit)\" depending on whether you have a 32-bit or 64-bit system. If you do not know which architecture your system has, right-click the Windows symbol in your task bar and go to \"System\". In the section \"Device specifications\" check the entry next to \"System type\".\n",
    "2. Once the installer has been downloaded, open it by double clicking. Click on \"Install now\" in the window that will appear:\n",
    "![Python installer image Windows](imgs/01_win_python_installer.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### macOS\n",
    "While Macs come with Python 2.7 pre-installed and you could just use that, we recommend you install the newest version of Python as follows:\n",
    "1. Go to the Mac OS X (sic!) section of the Python Software Foundation website [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/) and on the left side of the page under \"Stable Releases\" go to the latest version (as of now 3.9.2) and click on either \"macOS 64-bit Intel installer\" or \"macOS 64-bit universal2 installer\" depending on whether your machine has an Intel CPU or an Apple Silicon CPU. If you do not know which of the two your system has, click the Apple symbol in the top-left corner of your screen and go to \"About this Mac\". In the section \"Processor\" it will tell you what is inside.\n",
    "2. Once the installer has been downloaded, open it by double clicking. Click through the installer by hitting \"Continue\", accept the license and hit \"Install\".\n",
    "\n",
    "![Python installer image macOS](imgs/01_macos_python_installer.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Which IDE is right for you?\n",
    "As we quickly touched upon at the beginning of the chapter, you can leverage your productivity while writing code by using an IDE. Some of the available options have very elaborated features geared towards developing large software projects in a company context. Others are more focused on providing basic functionality for quick projects. While we do not know your exact needs in terms of features, we have listed some of the most widely used IDEs to assist you in choosing yourself. Depending on your choice you will have to go through a more or less complicated process to connect to the interpreter you just downloaded, which is one additional reason we recommend you start out with Google Colab where you will not have to worry about any of this.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a name=\"reference-2\"></a>\n",
    "#### Jupyter Notebooks and Google Colab\n",
    "IDEs geared towards editing Jupyter Notebooks, such as Google Colab, are somewhat different from \"traditional\" IDEs. They are based on so called *cells* that contain snippets of your code that can be run one-by-one. A cell can also hold text (formatted with [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/markdown)) to accompany your code, such as in this tutorial. You can edit Jupyter Notebooks in your browser with Google Colab and while there are no fancy features like AI-supported code analysis, it is an excellent way for beginners to get into coding fast and without downloading any additional tools. We again recommend you get your start in coding with Jupyter Notebooks on Google Colab [here](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "![Jupyter Notebook](imgs/01_jupyter.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Spyder\n",
    "Spyder is a free and open-source IDE geared towards data analysis. It is rather light-weight, meaning while it has all the most important core features as mentioned above, it is rather \"no frills\" in terms of automation features. You can learn more about Spyder [here](https://www.spyder-ide.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "![Spyder IDE](imgs/01_spyder.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### PyCharm\n",
    "PyCharm is one of the most popular and powerful IDEs out there. It includes rich features such as code analysis, machine learning enhanced code completion, Git integration (more on that [later](#main-paragraph-4)), web development tools (not included in the free version), and more. If you are planning on developing large scale projects with Python, PyCharm might be the IDE for you. You can learn more about it [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/).\n",
    "\n",
    "![PyCharm IDE](imgs/01_pycharm.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### VS Code\n",
    "Visual Studio Code is a light-weight code editor that supports a wide range of languages, among them - you guessed it - Python! While it offers helpful automation features and a Git integration, it is less rich overall which makes it a light and fast option to use if you want to develop small to mid sized projects. You can learn more about VS Code [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "![VS Code IDE](imgs/01_vscode.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Atom\n",
    "Atom is another light-weight text editor built to support a range of different languages. It supports Python through an extension you can install. Since it is built and maintained by GitHub it offers excellent version control and integration of libraries and packages from GitHub. Again, if you prefer a light and versatile code editor, you might want to look into using Atom. You can learn more about it [here](https://atom.io/).\n",

    "# GitHub as a tool to manage projects with multiple collaborators\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming in a business environment usually involves multiple programmers working on the same code simultaneously. This approach is called *non-linear development*. \n",
    "\n",
    "As you might imagine, trying to combine the different changes made to the code into one Python file (called \"*merging*\") and ensuring that potential errors and bugs do not hinder the usability of the released product are two big challenges in such environments. Doing these tasks manually would be an error-prone undertaking.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, there are tools called \n",
    "***Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS)***. \n",
    "DVCS have several advantages: they track changes made to a project file, ensure a system in which only approved changes end up modifying  the final program, and take over the merging of code. \n",
    "\n",
    "One such tool is **Git** which is usually accessed through a platform  called **GitHub**. Firstly, we will show the necessary steps to set-up GitHub on your computer and for your team. Then we will illustrate the workings of the version control software through the usage tutorial.\n",

    "### Step-by-step setup of GitHub and GitHub Desktop\n",
    "1) Go to https://github.com and click on **sign up** in the top right corner to create a **GitHub account**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Download **GitHub Desktop** from https://desktop.github.com/ and install the software on your computer\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Launch GitHub Desktop and log in with your credentials.\n",
    "\n",
    "With these steps you are all set-up to start working with GitHub!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note:* You can use a lot of the functionality of GitHub through the website without the need to download GitHub Desktop. However, if you want to edit code on your computer through an IDE, we recommend the installation of GitHub Desktop since it can automatically detect changes made to files and therefore eases the workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using GitHub to manage projects\n",
    "In this section, we illustrate how GitHub works as a version control system using a hands-on approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### In a nutshell:\n",
    "\n",
    "GitHub relies on a *“fork & pull”* model in which developers create their own copy of a **repository** (the main folder of the project, which is centrally stored on GitHub) by **forking**. Developers work on their local machine and **commit changes** to update their remote repository. Once they believe to be done with their code they submit a **pull request**. With the pull request, developers want the project master to pull their changes into the main branch. This will update the upstream repository and therefore the final, public version of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![Versioncontrol](imgs/01_git.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Creating a repository (\"Starting a project\")\n",
    "\n",
    "A repository is usually used to organize a single project. Therefore, creating a repository should be the first step when starting a new programming project.\n",
    "Repositories can contain folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets – anything your project needs. You are not limited to code. \n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend including a README file, a file with information about your project. GitHub makes it easy to automatically add one at the same time you create your new repository. It also offers other common options such as a license file.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**To create a new repository:**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1.   On the GitHub webpage: in the upper right corner, click on \"New repository\"\n",
    "2.   Name your repository\n",
    "3.   Write a short description\n",
    "4.   Select \"Initialize this repository with a README\"\n",
    "5.   Click \"Create repository\"\n",
    "\n",
    "![Create a repository](imgs/01_createRepository.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### \"Forking\" a project (\"Creating an individual repository\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you created your project repository, your team members can join in on collaborating on that project by \"*forking*\" your repository. This produces a personal copy of the main repository on which one member of the team can work alone. To do so, click on the \"**Fork**\" button when viewing your repository on GitHub.com.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Forking](imgs/01_fork.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "After forking you need to *clone* the repository to your local computer to be able to make changes. Simply go to the forked repository on the GitHub webpage and click on \"Code\", then select \"Open with GitHub Desktop\".\n",
    "\n",
    "![Cloning](imgs/01_clone.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "You now have all the files of the upstream repository saved on your local computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Branches \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the essential tools of GitHub is using **Branches**. Branches are separate versions of your project, which you can use to work on different ideas simultaneously. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Branches](imgs/01_branching.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "An example: you might want to add a new feature to your project and, at the same time, you also need to fix a bug (an error in your program). Instead of doing both in the same file simultaneously, it is better to do so on different branches: you can isolate the changes made and work on two different versions of the file. In case your new code somehow leads to further errors, you don't have to guess which changes were responsible or throw away both the problem fixing and feature part of your code. And once you are done, you can easily merge the branches back together. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**To create a branch:**\n",
    "1.    Go to your repository\n",
    "2.    Click the drop-down at the top of the file list that says *branch: main.*\n",
    "3.    Type a branch name into the new branch text box.\n",
    "4.    Select the blue **Create branch** box or hit “Enter” on your keyboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Create a branch](imgs/01_newBranch.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Making changes \n",
    "\n",
    "You can make changes to a file directly through the GitHub webpage or you can change the file on your computer locally. While the rest of this tutorial focused on the website interface, committing changes when modifying files on your computer works best through *GitHub Desktop*, since GitHub Desktop will automatically analyse which of the files were changed.\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "Simply open up your file through your IDE and save it normally. Once you are happy with your changes you can commit the changes. This is similar to uploading a file to the cloud. If you commit your changes and push them, those changes will be updated in the branch you are working on.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**To make changes through GitHub Desktop**\n",
    "1.   Open the file you want to change on your computer, change it, and save it normally\n",
    "2.   Open GitHub Desktop and navigate to your current repository to view the changed files (Orange indicates change, green a new file, red deletion)\n",
    "3.    Select the files you want to commit to the repository\n",
    "4.    Write a commit message, detailing the changes made\n",
    "5.    Commit the changes to the branch by clicking on \"commit to branchname\"\n",
    "\n",
    "![Changed files](imgs/01_commitChanges.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "5.    The following message should automatically appear after you made your commit. Push your changes to the remote repository by clicking on \"Push origin\". This \"uploads\" the changes from your local PC to your remote repository.\n",
    "![Push](imgs/01_push.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Merging and pull requests\n",
    "\n",
    "You successfully made your first changes to a branch! If you think back to the graph above, however, our changes are still only on a non-master branch and on our own repository. To merge changes from a local branch to the main repository, GitHub offers two tools: **Pushing** and **Pulling**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Push** is you forcing the changes being present into the target repository\n",
    "*   **Pull** is the target repository grabbing your changes, updating the target repository\n",
    "\n",
    "We already used push above to \"upload\" our changes from our local machine to our remote repository. In many cases, you are unable to *push* your changes, since you do not have the rights to change the main repository. Just think about it in a business setting: if every one of hundred employees could change the main repository, it would only take one disgruntled employee to delete everything. Therefore, in most cases, you will have to make a pull request.\n",
    "\n",

    "Pull Requests are the heart of collaboration on GitHub. When you open a pull request, you are *requesting* that the original author *reviews your proposed changes* and *pulls in your contribution* and, if found useful, *merges* them into their branch. Pull requests show the differences between the content from both branches. The changes, additions, and subtractions are shown in green and red.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step-by-step, a pull request works in the following ways:**\n",
    "1.    Navigate to the main upstream repository (e.g. through the GitHub webpage) \n",
    "2.    If you recently pushed changes on your remote repository you should see a button **\"Compare & pull request\"**\n",
    "![Compare & pull](imgs/01_compare_pull.png)\n",
    "2.    In *base repository* select the branch of the main (upstream) repository you want to merge your changes into\n",
    "3.    In *head repository* select your fork (your remote repository) and the branch you made your changes in.\n",
    "4.    Type in a title and description for your pull request\n",

    "#### Tips \n",
    "GitHub can seem daunting at first but there are a couple of ways to learn practically. For example: You can open pull requests in your own repository and merge them yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using GitHub’s @mention system in your pull request message, you can ask for feedback from specific people or teams, whether they’re down the hall or 10 time zones away.\n",
    "\n",
    "When programing, use the following rule of thumb: anything in the main branch is always deployable (meaning: only finished and functional features should be included in the main branch, both of your remote and the upstream repository). \n",
    "In this regard, it can be useful to first merge your proposed changes to your own main branch, before creating a pull request for the upstream repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "GitHub is not only a tool to work with your colleagues, it is also a place where many open source projects originate. Looking through the code of public GitHub projects can be a great way to find inspiration of the possibilities offered through programming.\n",

    "As you start writing your first lines of code, you will inevitably make mistakes. This, however, is totally normal and happens to everyone all the time - even to the most experienced programmers. Even if those encrypted-looking, frightening red error messages seem annoying and unsatisfactory, it is of most importance to know how to deal with them. Therefore, try to look at your mistakes as the best way to improve your skills and your Python-knowledge and most importantly: don’t panic! This being said, we will now focus on how to interpret an error message and where to look for help efficiently. \n",

    "In this example, we assigned the integer ```10``` to a variable called ```alpha``` and the integer ```20``` to another variable called ```beta```. Then we assigned the result of the sum of ```alpha``` and ```beta``` to a variable called ```gamma```. To show the result of the simple calculation, we used the built-in ```print``` function: ```print(Gamma)```. \n",

    "As you can see, an error occurs. Let us show step by step how to deal with this specific error message. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Name Error](imgs/01_ErrorMessagePython.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend that you start analyzing the error message from bottom to top, as the black arrow suggests. This is due to the following reason (inspired by https://realpython.com/python-traceback/):\n",
    "\n",
    "What appears first is the name of the error, **highlighted yellow** in the upper left corner. This gives you a first impression of what went wrong: in this particular case we are obviously dealing with a ```NameError.``` However, the **second yellow box at the bottom of the code** contains exactly the same information, but in more detail. It further tells us that we forgot to define a variable called ```Gamma```. As can be seen, the latter contains additional information, which suggests that we read this one first.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we consider the **green area**, which the arrow points to. This way, the traceback automatically locates the error in the code. In this case, the ```NameError``` appeared in the fifth line. \n",
    "\n",
    "The rest of the error message gives further information on the file name, module name etc. It simply specifies where to find a code, but this part of the error message is rather negligible for our purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the given information, we can **conclude** that the error occured because we tried to print out a variable called ```Gamma```, which isn't recognised by Python (because Python is a case-sensitive programming language, i.e., it clearly differetiates between lowercase and uppercase letters, as you will learn later on in another tutorial).\n",
    "\n",
    "**A more general way to analyze an error, detached from a specific example**\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the above example was rather easy, you might ask yourself how to interpret and use such a traceback in another setting, i.e., for another, more complex code. \n",
    "This clearly motivates the following outcome-oriented approach: \n",
    "1. Make sure you understand which error occured (e.g. a ```NameError```)\n",
    "2. Follow the traceback message from bottom to top to find out in which line the error occured (e.g. in ```line 5```)\n",
    "3. Ask yourself what the intended code should do\n",
    "4. Try to understand exactly what the code did instead \n",
    "5. Come up with solutions to fix the problem \n",
    "\n",
    "The first four steps became clear with the above example. However, the fifth and maybe most important step - fixing your code to make it work eventually - may cause various difficulties. \n",
    "That's why knowing where to look for help is an aboslutely crucial part of programming. In this respect, we may consider ourselves lucky to be programming in Python, since it has a huge community willing to help you. Most problems which you will be confronted with will very likely alredy have been asked and answered by another programmer. \n",
    "The arguably most popular forum is called \"Stack Overflow\", which is a great way to look for answers. Just try googling \"How to do XYZ in Python\" and you will most likely be directed to a Stack Overflow post.\n",
    "One of the many useful gadgets of Google Colab is the fact that you can search for an answer to your own error message in a blink of a second - just click on the button \"Search Stack Overflow\" at the end of a traceback (check the screenshot above).\n",
    "\n",
    "As previously emphasized, it is essential that you try not to ignore error messages, since this is the only way to really improve in coding and get a broader understanding of how the computer reacts to certain inputs. Additionaly, even though it may seem to slow you down in the beginning, it is definitely the most time efficient way to deal with a problem while coding: as a beginner, you probably won't find your mistake without some external help."
